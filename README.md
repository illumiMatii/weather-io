# weather-io
Weather website project where user can get information about forecast in given city/town/village etc.

## :partly_sunny: About
This is my first project where I used **async** functions in JavaScript and that was it main purpose, improve my programming skills. 

## :green_book: API
To get information about forecast I used [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API.


## :sun_with_face: Icons
I decided to change the main API icons, beacuse they didn't fit into design of webpage. The choice fell on [weather-icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons).
